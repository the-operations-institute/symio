# Symio
The Symio Applications Platform is an open-source platform conceived and maintained by [The Operations Institute](http://theoperationsinstitute.org) to decentralize and open up what has become a tragically centralized and proprietary cloud. It's primary goals are

* to support a fully distributed filesystem concept that views your files as a *single filesystem* distributed across a number of different devices, rather than multiple filesystems that all contain files that pertain to you;
* to encourage the creation of applications built to function as well offline as they do online;
* to encourage 100% interface/data separation and data classification, allowing the creation of multiple unique interfaces that work with the same data; and
* to promote a fully granular micro-service architecture, designed to allow "hot-swappable" program components even in closed-source applications.

# Come Work On Symio!
Symio is the first of what will be a long heritage of extremely high quality open source technology solutions managed by The Operations Institute to supercharge productivity and effectiveness in the nonprofit world. While the platform was conceived by The Operations Institute as a fundamental building block for solutions for nonprofit operations, it has yet to be expanded on and implemented.

We're currently looking for one or two primary partners who have the skills and the passion to build the platform and the essential applications that run on it. While these positions are currently unpaid, they may still be considered formal positions and equity partnerships, and the goal is that they will be funded for the long term within the next two years.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to [kael.shipman@theoperationsinstitute.org](mailto:kael.shipman@theoperationsinstitute.org) with any questions, comments, encouragement or suggestions.
